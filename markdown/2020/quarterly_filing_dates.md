## Quarterly HMDA Filing Period Dates

Beginning January 1, 2020, the 2015 HMDA Final Rule requires quarterly reporting for financial institutions that reported a combined total of at least 60,000 applications and covered loans, excluding purchased covered loans, for the preceding calendar year. Thus, in addition to their annual data submission, these larger-volume reporters will submit HMDA data for each of the first three quarters of the year on a quarterly basis. Further information can be found in Regulation C, 12 CFR 1003.5(a)(1)(ii).

If you need additional information to help get your file ready you can refer to the [Supplemental Guide for Quarterly Filers](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cfpb-hmda-public/prod/help/supplemental-guide-for-quarterly-filers.pdf) for 2020.
