## HMDA Data Browser Frequently Asked Questions

- **How do I use this tool?** 
Answer: The HMDA Data Browser allows users to filter and download HMDA datasets. Users can select from geographic areas that theyâ€™d like to filter by. Upon selection, they can then download a CSV file that includes this geographic data, along with all 99 public data fields. If a user would like to filter data further, they can select from up to two of 11 available variables. Users can then view an aggregated summary table of the data requested and download a CSV file of the filtered data.

- **What years of HMDA data are available?**

- **What is a CSV?** 
Answer: A comma-separated values (CSV) file derives its name from a file containing multiple data fields separated by commas to distinguish where each field starts and ends. Files are stored in plain text as numbers and letters with one record per line. As long as the CSV file meets row/column limits, it can be opened in Microsoft Excel.

- **Why has the column order in the CSV file changed?** 
Answer: The columns of the Static and Dynamic dataset, including data available through the Data Browser, have been reordered to create logical groupings. This reordering was done to facilitate analysis in desktop spreadsheet software for files pulled from the Data Browser.
